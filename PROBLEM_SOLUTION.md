# Problem-Solving Report

## 1. Problem Statement

Implement a feature to search for podcasts and display the results in a user-friendly way.

---

## 2. Solution Approach

- The project has been divided into smaller and reusable components to promote maintainability and scalability.
- Shared components have been add in (`src/home/shared`) for reusability and clean code.
- I created a custom hook (`src/hooks/useITunesSearch.tsx`) to handle API requests to the iTunes Search API.
- Built UI components (`src/components/Spinner.tsx`, `src/components/NoResult.tsx`, etc.) to display loading states and results.
- Integrated the search functionality into the main page (`src/app/page.tsx`), ensuring results update as the user types.

## 3. Main Difficulties Faced

- **API Rate Limiting:** The iTunes API sometimes throttled requests. I added debouncing in the search input to reduce unnecessary calls.
- **UI State Management:** Managing loading, error, and empty states required careful conditional rendering in the UI components.
- **TypeScript Types:** Ensuring type safety for API responses required defining and refining types in `src/types/itunes-search.ts`.

## 4. Suggestions & Alternative Solutions

- **Caching Results:** Implementing a caching layer (e.g., using React Query or SWR) could reduce redundant API calls and improve performance.
- **Error Handling:** More robust error handling and user feedback could be added for network failures.
- **Testing:** Adding unit and integration tests for the custom hook and UI components would increase reliability.

## 5. Conclusion

The implemented solution meets the requirements and provides a responsive search experience. The main challenges were addressed, but there is room for further optimization and testing.
